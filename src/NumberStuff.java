        // NUMERIC DATA TYPES

        // RAM not to be confused with storage
        // 4,8,16gb of RAM common
        // Greek prefixes -
        // 1000 bytes = 1 kilobyte, meca, giga, terra (greek prefixes)
        // memory in computers tends to be based on powers of 2
        // number 1000 is not a power of 2
        // closest number to 1000 that would be power of 2 is 1024
        // and so if we were to say a computer has 1 kilobyte of ram we would liely mean that it has 1024 bytes, not 1000 bytes
        // that explains why weird numbers instead of nice even whole numbers, is because memory in computers tends to be measured in powers of 2
        // find some unused space in computer in wich to store this new thing

        // computer has 8gb of RAM so 8 billion roughly (power of 2)
        // 1 of those bytes will be assigned number 13

        // BOOLEANS
        // smallest data type is a boolean - only requires 1 bit
        // operating sysmte and java  working together may just use a byte as that is the smallest thing that can be addressed (is a 1 byte) or if Java has a tricky way so that for every bits that we allocate it sotres it in 1 byte,
        // but this could be wasteful if working with trillions of bits
        // a bit is 1 or 0 - if it's 0 (false) 1 = true - boolean

        // Byte (-128 to 127)
        // by default most of basic numerical types in Java are signed numbers - meaning can be negative or positive
        // however, if didnt need to store negative numbers with smething like a bte (unsigned) then you could store a number in a byte up to 0 to 255
        // 128+64+32+16+8+4+2+1 = 255
        // however, reason why range is -128 to 127 - simplification :
        // 'Most significant bit'
        // important concept: combination of the amount of space that we take up in the computer vs the largest range of numbers that we need to represnet, that helps up to decide what data type we shoudl use
        // why not use the largest data type? because it would be wasteful of memory
        // typically we want to use the smallest data type that would enable us to achieve what we want to do

        // After Booleans and bytes, a SHORT is a the next smallest type
        // SHORT (-32,768 to 32,767) = 16 bits (2 bytes)
        // Also data type of CHAR is represneted with 2 bytes
        // alphabet - 26 letters (not 32,000 chars?!?)
        // Java wanted to be compatiable with all languages on earth
        // to represnet all languages you need a really big range
        // in CHAR no longer need - minus numbers.

        // Java's default encoding scheme isn't ACSII it's Unicode, but creators of Unicode did for latin letters was to start off with ACSII
        // and so all of the characters that are known to acsii actually have the same values in unicode as well
        // Korean works differently to latin - unicode econdes entire syllables
        // korene chars clustered together in a single char 0 and so it makes more sense to tthem to econde eaehc and every syllanble of the korean language as its own speerate character
        // so imagine how many chars would you need inorder to represnet every syllable in a language especially a anguage like korean - thousands
        // so that's why CHAR type is so big to accomodate all lagnuages and all syllalables and chars in all languages!

        //
        // when the computer repsents a number like 3.11592 in float or double, the steps it will go through are: it will not attempt to store the number directly, instead it will try to get hte number to a format that is more compatible with the way that it internally sotres things.
        // it will take the number and determine wheter it is bigger than 2, and keep dviiding the number until it is less than 2, in this case ti would only have to do it 1 time, and it would also keep track of the number of times it has to divide it by 2, that number of times would then be added to the number 127, so in this case 128 becaus it would only have to dvide once, would be econded here in the exponent area, and so this dividision by 2 is the equivalent to moving the decimal place.
